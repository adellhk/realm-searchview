A simple and powerful `EditText` and `RecyclerView` UI component.
It's build on top of `RealmRecyclerView` and `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter`.

It's easily customizable via layout attributes and adapter parameters.

## How To Get Started:

The `RealmSearchView` is a wrapper around a `EditText` and `RealmRecyclerView`. The `RealmSearchAdapter` has added functionality for the filtering of the Realm. 

##RealmSearchView

The snippet below shows how to include the `RealmSearchView` in your  layout file.

```
    <co.moonmonkeylabs.realmsearchview.RealmSearchView
        android:id="@+id/search_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:rsvHint="@string/search_hint"
        />
```

The `RealmSearchView` can be with two attributes:

* `rsvHint`: This is the search box hint. It a string reference.

* `rsvClearDrawable`: This is for the clear drawable. It's a drawable reference.

##RealmSearchAdapter

The adapter does all the filtering. The following list of parameters are available to customize the filtering. 

* `filterKey`: The filterKey is required as it is the columnName that the results are filtered by.

* `useContains`: If true, uses `contains`, otherwise uses `beginsWith`.

* `useCaseSensitive`: If true, ensures that the filter is respecting casing. If false, ignores any casing.

* `sortAscending`: If true, ascending, otherwise descending.

* `sortKey`: The columnName by which the results should be sorted.

* `basePredicate`: The basePredicate is used to filter the results whenever the searchBar is empty.

The `RealmSearchAdapter` has two constructors. One that only takes the `filterKey` parameter and one that takes all parameters.
In addition, the adapter has to be provided with a valid instance of Realm. It is used throughout the life of view to requery the results.
